# Anime Finder
_discover anime by searching or via a questionnaire_

This is inspired by lukeatlook's [anime recommendation flowchart](https://imgur.com/gallery/q9Xjv4p), which via a series of questions leads the user to a specific anime to watch.

The project uses an offline database complied by manami-project's [anime-offline-database](https://github.com/manami-project/anime-offline-database).
