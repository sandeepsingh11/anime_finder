_discover anime via a flowchart_


### [https://animeflow.netlify.app/](https://animeflow.netlify.app/)

This is inspired by lukeatlook's [anime recommendation flowchart](https://imgur.com/gallery/q9Xjv4p), which via a series of questions leads the user to a specific anime to watch.

This flowchart utilizes [Jikan](https://jikan.moe/)â€™s REST API, which allows for the searching and retriving of anime info from MyAnimeList. Jikan provides many other awesome anime features, so go check out their [Github](https://github.com/jikan-me/jikan)!!
